## Overview

### The challenge

Visitors should be able to:

- Real time visitor's full name, email addresses and credit card information via custom RegEx
  - Name field validates if there are numbers inputted into the field, and if so, throws an error
  - Email field validates if the email is formatted correctly, and throws errors if there's any spaces in the email address
  - Credit Card/ZipCode/CVV field validates the digits inputted into this field, and throws an error when there is anything other a digit inputted
- Preview the total cost based on the activities selected
- Utilize Paypal and Bitcoin payment options to complete registration

### What I learned

While working on this project, I solidified my knowledge with using regex to validate form inputs and learned how to manipulate <option> elements.

### Useful resources

- [Regexr](https://regexr.com/) - This site has helped me with testing my regex and ensuring that I'm validating the appropriate characters
- [Regex101](https://regex101.com) - This site helped me with learning the different switches and how to properly format my regex to check specific test cases

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to give thanks to the Student Success Mentors with Team Treehouse, the other students in their Slack channel and my friends on Discord that helped me along the way. Without everyone's support, I'd still be figuring out how to use Regex to validate this registration form.
